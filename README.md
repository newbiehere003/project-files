Hello viewer, thank you for taking valuable time out of your life to look at my projects. I have completed 2 Power BI projects and 1 SQL project.

1. The first project, titled "New Project," is my latest accomplishment, showcasing my refined skills and demonstrating how much I have learned, as well as how I can be valuable to you.

This project focuses on the 2-year sales data of the company (1997-1998). The company has multiple brands and products, primarily selling in North America.

The operations performed before the visualizations included data cleaning, data organizing, and creating various measures according to the needs. Then, data modelling was performed, and finally, data visualization resulted in insightful findings.

2. The second project, named "Project on Electric Vehicle Sales Insights," is my first Power BI project and brought me great joy as I learned from it.

In this project, the company aims to enter the electric vehicle market in India and is therefore looking to analyze the market to determine which marketing strategies they should implement to establish a foothold in the Indian market.

The project began with data cleaning, data transformation, creating DAX measures, data modelling, and finally, data visualization and insights.

3. The project was a fun SQL project focused on solving a murder mystery. Here, I was tasked with solving the crime by using multiple files, retrieving information from them, and taking notes so that I would know which queries to use next and how to find the subsequent data to ultimately solve the crime.

The queries I used to ultimately solve the crime are provided in the third file.
